# GPU Specific

AMD -
    agdpmod=pikera
        * Disabling board ID checks on some Navi GPU (5000 && 6000 series).
        * Without this you'll get a black screen. Don't use if you don't have Navi (ie. Polaris and Vega cards shouldn't use this)

    -radcodec
        Used for allowing officially unsupported AMD GPUs to use native Hardware Video Encoder
    
    unfairgva=1
        Fix hardware DRM support on supported AMD GPU

iGPU (Intel/AMD) -
    -wegnoegpu
        * Used for disabling all other GPU's EXPECT for the integrated, useful for those wanting to run newer versions with
        Unsupported Navi / Nvidia cards

# Some system config

 csr-activeconfig: 00000000
    Settings for System Integrity Protection (SIP).
    Generally recommended to change this with csrutil via the recovery partition.
        csr-activeconfig by default is set to 00000000 which enables SIP. Choose a number of different values BUT
        overall we recommend kekeping this enabled for best security practices.
            More info found on: (https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/troubleshooting/extended/post-issues.html#disabling-sip)

# DELETE
# Still under NVRAM

WriteFlash: YES
    Forcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that 'Add' WILL NOT overwrite values already present in NVRAM
    so boot-args should be left alone.
